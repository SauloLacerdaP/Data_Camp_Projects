In many countries insurance it is a legal requirement to have car insurance in order to drive a vehicle on public roads, so the market is very large!\n",

As they have very little expertise and infrastructure for deploying and monitoring machine learning models, they've asked you to identify the single feature that results in the best performing model, as measured by accuracy, so they can start with a simple model in production.\n",
